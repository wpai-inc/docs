CodeWP can 'look' at your website, helping you to understand what's on it and how it's structured. This AI Vision feature is helpful when generating code, troubleshooting, and more.

To use Vision, you must have a connected project. Once the project is connected, you can use the vision feature on any URL with the project's domain.
