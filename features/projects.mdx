Projects exist for two primary reasons; to help you organize your work and to help provide CodeWP with more context.

### Organize

Snippets, packages, and chats associated with projects are grouped together. This helps you organize your work, and makes it easier to find things later.

### Context

Users can add a description, goals, code prefix, and notes to a project. This information is used to help provide context to CodeWP's AI resulting in more personalized and accurate suggestions/generations.

### Agency Features

If you're an agency, you can create projects for each of your clients. This will help you organize your work. The Agency plan also comes with multiple team members, and (collaboration)[https://docs.codewp.ai/features/collaboration] features work best when you're using projects.

<Tip>Here's a sneak preview of upcoming features.</Tip>

**Projects are an important aspect of features that are coming soon, such as:**

- Troubleshoot

Troubleshooting your site is a big, time consuming process, that every WordPress creator is all too familiar with. CodeWP will soon have a dedicated troubleshooting mode, and projects will help provide context to the our AI. The project will connect directly with your WordPress site, using a helper plugin, and provide our AI visibility into your site's configuration, active plugins, codebase, and more.

When you have an issue, the AI will be able to use this information to help you troubleshoot your site instantly.

- Security

AI offers a revolutionary leap in securing WordPress sites. CodeWP will soon be able to monitor your site for security issues, and automatically fix them. Projects will help provide context to the AI, so it can better understand your site and its configuration.

- Insights

You'll be able to leverage [Chat Mode](https://docs.codewp.ai/features/chat) to ask questions about your site, and get answers instantly. Complex things like "CodeWP, what was the month over month growth of my site's user registrations?" will be answered instantly.

**All of these features will be opt-in and only available if you install the helper plugin, and connect a CodeWP project to the site.**
